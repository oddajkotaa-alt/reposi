# Checkpoints & Rewind

## Overview

Before making risky or irreversible changes, create a checkpoint. If things go wrong, rewind to the checkpoint. This gives you the confidence to experiment without fear of breaking things.

**Core principle:** Every multi-file change starts with a safety net.

## When to Use

- **Before large refactors** — Moving code, renaming files, changing architecture
- **Before deleting anything** — Files, directories, database data
- **Before destructive git operations** — `git reset`, `git rebase`, `git clean`
- **Before trying experimental approaches** — "Let's see if this works"
- **At the start of any task that modifies 3+ files**
- **Before running auto-fix in code review** (Step 7 of requesting-code-review)

**Do NOT use for:** Single-file edits, reading files, running tests, or any operation that's trivially undoable.

## How to Create a Checkpoint

### Method 1: Git Commit (Recommended)

```bash
# Before making changes
git add -A && git commit -m "[checkpoint] before <description>"

# Make your changes...

# If things go wrong:
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# If things go right:
# Keep the checkpoint commit, or squash it later
```

### Method 2: Git Stash (For Experiments)

```bash
# Before making changes
git stash push -m "checkpoint: <description>"

# Make your changes... (starting from clean state)

# If things go wrong:
git stash pop  # restore the checkpoint (undoes your changes)

# If things go right:
git stash drop  # discard the checkpoint
```

### Method 3: Manual Backup (No Git)

```bash
# Before making changes
cp -r important_file.ts important_file.ts.checkpoint

# Make your changes...

# If things go wrong:
cp important_file.ts.checkpoint important_file.ts

# Clean up after success:
rm important_file.ts.checkpoint
```

## Naming Convention

Always include:
- `[checkpoint]` prefix (easy to search in git log)
- What you're about to do
- Date/time if helpful

Good:
```
[checkpoint] before refactoring ChantingHall to adapter pattern
[checkpoint] before trying experimental rendering approach
[checkpoint] before deleting old story-data.js
```

Bad:
```
[checkpoint] save
[checkpoint] before changes
wip
```

## Rewind Process

When you need to undo:

### Step 1: Assess the Damage

```bash
# See what changed
git status
git diff --stat

# See recent commits
git log --oneline -5
```

### Step 2: Choose Rewind Method

**Scenario A: Just checkpointed, no other commits in between**
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**Scenario B: Checkpoint was several commits ago**
```bash
# Find the checkpoint commit
git log --oneline --grep="\[checkpoint\]"

# Revert to it
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

**Scenario C: Need to keep some changes, undo others**
```bash
# Reset specific files
git checkout <commit-hash> -- path/to/file.ts

# Or use interactive reset
git reset -p HEAD~1
```

**Scenario D: Already pushed to remote**
```bash
# DON'T force push. Instead:
git revert <commit-hash>
# This creates a new commit that undoes the changes (safe for shared repos)
```

### Step 3: Verify the Rewind

```bash
# Check the project still works
npm test -- --passWithNoTests 2>&1 | tail -5
# Or
npm run build 2>&1 | tail -5
```

## Integration with Other Skills

- **think-tool** — Use Think Tool before deciding whether to checkpoint
- **subagent-driven-development** — Each subagent should checkpoint before starting its task
- **requesting-code-review** — Auto-fix loop (Step 7) should checkpoint before attempting fixes
- **spec-driven-development** — Checkpoint before Phase 4 (Implement)

## Best Practices

1. **Checkpoint early, checkpoint often** — Better to have too many than too few
2. **Use descriptive messages** — "before refactor" not "save"
3. **Don't rely on the undo buffer** — Editor undo only works within the same session
4. **Clean up old checkpoints** — After a successful task, squash or drop checkpoint commits
5. **Combine with Think Tool** — Think first, then checkpoint, then act

## Common Mistakes

- **Not checkpointing before destructive operations** — "I'll just be careful" is not a strategy
- **Checkpointing after starting changes** — The checkpoint must be BEFORE, not during
- **Forgetting to clean up** — Old checkpoint files and commits accumulate
- **Skipping verification** — Always verify after rewind to make sure it worked

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command | When |
|--------|---------|------|
| Git checkpoint | `git add -A && git commit -m "[checkpoint] ..."` | Before changes |
| Stash checkpoint | `git stash push -m "checkpoint: ..."` | Before experiments |
| File backup | `cp file file.checkpoint` | No git / single file |
| Rewind (last commit) | `git reset --hard HEAD~1` | Undo all changes |
| Rewind (specific) | `git reset --hard <hash>` | Undo to specific point |
| Selective undo | `git checkout <hash> -- <file>` | Undo specific file |
| Safe undo (pushed) | `git revert <hash>` | Don't force push |
| Clean checkpoint commit | `git rebase -i HEAD~N` | Squash during cleanup |
