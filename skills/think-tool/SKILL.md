# Think Tool

## Overview

Before making complex or irreversible decisions, **stop and think**. The Think Tool is a structured reasoning step that happens *before* you act — not after. It's the difference between guessing and understanding.

**Core principle:** If you're not sure, think first. If you're sure, think again.

## When to Use

Use Think Tool whenever:

- **Multiple approaches exist** — "I could do X or Y" → Stop, think, decide
- **Irreversible changes** — Deleting files, modifying database, pushing to main branch
- **Complex multi-step operations** — More than 3 tool calls in sequence
- **Error recovery** — Something failed and you're about to try a fix
- **Before using potentially destructive tools** — `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `DROP TABLE`
- **You catch yourself rushing** — "Just try this and see" is a red flag
- **Ambiguous requirements** — Not sure what the user actually wants

**Do NOT use for:** Simple, obvious operations (single file edit, reading a file, running tests)

## How to Think

When you call Think Tool, work through these steps in order:

### Step 1: State the Situation

In one sentence, what's happening?

> "I need to refactor the ChantingHall feature from 4 files to 2 files."

### Step 2: List the Options

What are the possible approaches?

> Option A: Merge Manager + UI into one file, keep Types separate
> Option B: Merge everything into one file
> Option C: Keep current 4-file structure, just add new features

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option

For each option, answer:
- **Pros** — What's good about this?
- **Cons** — What's the risk?
- **Effort** — How much work?
- **Alignment** — Does it match the project's existing patterns?

### Step 4: Make a Decision

State clearly what you're going to do and why. Then proceed.

> "I'll go with Option A because it reduces complexity while keeping type definitions clean and reusable."

## Output Format

When using Think Tool, output your reasoning in this format:

```
🧠 Think Tool
─────────────
Situation: [one sentence]

Options:
1. [Option A] — [brief description]
   → Pros: [...]
   → Cons: [...]
   → Effort: [small/medium/large]

2. [Option B] — [brief description]
   → Pros: [...]
   → Cons: [...]
   → Effort: [small/medium/large]

Decision: [Option X]
Reason: [why this one wins]
```

## Integration with Other Skills

- **systematic-debugging** — Use Think Tool before attempting any fix (Phase 3 hypothesis formation)
- **spec-driven-development** — Use Think Tool during Phase 1 (Specify) when requirements are ambiguous
- **security-hardening-checklist** — Use Think Tool before making security-relevant decisions
- **requesting-code-review** — Use Think Tool before dispatching the reviewer (check your own work first)

## Examples

### Example 1: Choosing a refactor approach

```
🧠 Think Tool
─────────────
Situation: Need to refactor data-manager.js to support both localStorage and wx.setStorage

Options:
1. Adapter pattern — Create a StorageAdapter interface with two implementations
   → Pros: Clean separation, easy to add new storage backends
   → Cons: More files, may be over-engineering for 2 backends
   → Effort: Medium

2. if/else in existing code — Add platform detection and branch
   → Pros: Quick, minimal files changed
   → Cons: Messy, hard to test, violates SRP
   → Effort: Small

3. Abstract base class — Create StorageProvider base, LocalProvider + WxProvider
   → Pros: Clean, follows existing class patterns in the project
   → Cons: More boilerplate than adapter
   → Effort: Medium

Decision: Option 1 (Adapter pattern)
Reason: Despite being slightly more code, it keeps the codebase clean and makes future storage backends trivial to add. Option 2 is a debt we'd pay later.
```

### Example 2: Debugging a gray screen

```
🧠 Think Tool
─────────────
Situation: Cocos Creator scene shows gray screen, no error in console

Options:
1. Check Canvas node — Most common cause: Canvas has no children or camera issue
   → Pros: Fastest check, high probability
   → Cons: None

2. Check scene JSON integrity — corrupted __id__ references
   → Pros: Catches structural issues
   → Cons: Slower, must parse JSON

3. Check component bindings — script reference broken
   → Pros: Catches bindings issues
   → Cons: Need to check each component

Decision: Option 1 first, then 3, then 2
Reason: Follow probability order — Canvas/camera is the most common cause and fastest to verify.
```

### Example 3: Before destructive operation

```
🧠 Think Tool
─────────────
Situation: User asked me to "clean up old files" — which files?

Options:
1. Ask user to specify exact files — safest
   → Pros: No risk of deleting wrong files
   → Cons: User has to come back

2. List files with last-modified dates, let user confirm
   → Pros: User sees what they're approving
   → Cons: Slower

3. Guess and delete — dangerous
   → Pros: Fast
   → Cons: High risk of deleting something important

Decision: Option 2
Reason: Balances speed with safety. User sees the list, I explain what's safe to delete.
```

## Pitfalls

- **Over-thinking** — Don't use Think Tool for obvious decisions. If the answer is clear, just do it.
- **Analysis paralysis** — Set a mental timer: 30 seconds for small decisions, 2 minutes for big ones.
- **Confirmation bias** — Don't use Think Tool to justify what you already decided. Be genuinely open to the other options.
- **Skipping the "why"** — The decision without the reasoning is useless. Always state why you chose one option.
- **Not updating the plan** — After thinking, if your plan changes, update the user or the task list.
